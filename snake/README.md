# Snake Game

Coding Challenge #3: The Snake Game (https://youtu.be/AaGK-fj-BAM)

A playable [Demo](https://toferj.github.io/p5js/snake/) can be found here.

### TODO:
- Add Count Down start (3, 2, 1...GO!)
- Add longest snake record... without a DB or some sort of online storage, this would only be per game session...
- It seems impossible to ride along the walls now. Check wall collision detection.
  (as a stopgap, I just made it where food will never be placed exactly on any wall)

Anything other ideas?
